## API

The entrypoint to the library is the `sylkrtc` object. Several objects (`Connection`, `Account` and `Call`) inherit from Node's `EventEmitter` class, you may want to check [its documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html).


### sylkrtc

The main entrypoint to the library. It exposes the main function to connect to SylkServer and some utility functions for general use.


#### sylkrtc.createConnection(options={})

Creates a `sylkrtc` connection towards a SylkServer instance. The supported options are "server" and optional object "userAgent". Where server should point to the WebSocket endpoint of the WebRTC gateway application. Example: `wss://1.2.3.4:8088/webrtcgateway/ws`.

It returns a `Connection` object.

Example:

    let connection = sylkrtc.createConnection({server: 'wss://1.2.3.4:8088/webrtcgateway/ws'});

If the optional userAgent object is given, it should contain:
* `name` : string with the name of the application.
* `version`: version string of the application.

Example with userAgent:

    let connection = sylkrtc.createConnection({server: 'wss://1.2.3.4:8088/webrtcgateway/ws', userAgent: {name: 'Some Apllication', version: '0.99.9'}});


#### sylkrtc.utils

Helper module with utility functions.

* `attachMediaStream`: function to easily attach a media stream to an element. It reexports [attachmediastream](https://github.com/otalk/attachMediaStream).
* `closeMediaStream`: function to close the given media stream.
* `sanatizeHtml`: function to XSS sanitize html strings

### Connection

Object representing the interaction with SylkServer. Multiple connections can be created with
`sylkrtc.createConnection`, but typically only one is needed. Reconnecting in case the connection is interrupted is
taken care of automatically.

Events emitted:
* **stateChanged**: indicates the WebSocket connection state has changed. Two arguments are provided: `oldState` and
  `newState`, the old connection state and the new connection state, respectively. Possible state values are: null,
  connecting, connected, ready, disconnected and closed. If the connection is involuntarily interrupted the state will
  transition to disconnected and the connection will be retried. Once the closed state is set, as a result of the user
  calling Connection.close(), the connection can no longer be used or reconnected.


#### Connection.addAccount(options={}, cb=null)

Configures an `Account` to be used through `sylkrtc`.  2 options are required: *account* (the account ID) and
*password*. An optional *displayName* can be set. The account won't be registered, it will just be created.
Optionally *realm* can be passed, which will be used instead of the domain for the HA1 calculation.

The *password* won't be stored or transmitted as given, the HA1 hash (as used in
[Digest access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication)) is created and used instead.

The `cb` argument is a callback which will be called with an error and the account object
itself.

Example:

    connection.addAccount({account: saghul@sip2sip.info, password: 1234}, function(error, account) {
        if (error) {
            console.log('Error adding account!' + account);
        } else {
            console.log('Account added!');
        }
    });


#### Connection.removeAccount(account, cb=null)

Removes the given account. The callback will be called once the operation completes (it
cannot fail). The callback will be called with an error object.

Example:

    connection.removeAccount(account, function(error) {
        console('Account removed!');
    });


#### Connection.reconnect()

Starts reconnecting immediately if the state was 'disconnected';


#### Connection.close()

Close the connection with SylkServer. All accounts will be unbound.


#### Connection.state

Getter property returning the current connection state.


### Account

Object representing a SIP account which will be used for making / receiving calls.

Events emitted:
* **registrationStateChanged**: indicates the SIP registration state has changed. Three arguments are provided:
  `oldState`, `newState` and `data`. `oldState` and `newState` represent the old registration state and the new

   * null: registration hasn't started or it has ended
   * registering: registration is in progress

  `mediaTypes` object, which has 2 boolean properties: `audio` and `video`, indicating if those media types were
  present in the initial SDP.

  attribute, which is an `Identity` object.

  results. A single argument is provided: a list of `messages`. Each `message`
  has the following fields:
    * contact: contact of the message. For outgoing messages it is the receiver, for incoming it is the sender.
    * content: message content,
    * content_type: message content type. Special content types exist to handle events:
        * message/imdn: the content field will contain the message_id,
          message_timestamp and state for the disposition change.
        * application/sylk-message-remove: the content will contain the contact
